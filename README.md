Meta Q-Learning Pac-Man Game ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾
Description
This project implements a Pac-Man game using Pygame, enhanced with a Meta Q-Learning algorithm for dynamic and adaptive gameplay. The game features a complex maze with a start and end point, and includes two ghosts that move around the maze. The game aims to find the fastest route for Pac-Man to reach the end point while avoiding ghosts and collecting rewards. The project includes continuous learning with hyperparameter adjustments to improve the performance over multiple episodes.

Model Used
Meta Q-Learning Algorithm: Combines traditional Q-Learning with meta-learning techniques to enhance Pac-Man's decision-making process, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation based on gameplay experience.

Main Findings
Efficient Pathfinding: The model successfully identifies the fastest routes for Pac-Man to reach the end point, minimizing travel time and avoiding obstacles.
Dynamic Ghost Interaction: The presence of two moving ghosts adds complexity and variability to each game session, challenging the model's adaptability.
Continuous Improvement: The meta-learning approach allows for hyperparameter tuning, leading to performance enhancements over multiple gameplay episodes.
Methodology
Game Initialization: Initializes Pygame, sets up the game window, defines constants for colors, screen size, and grid size, loads the maze, and converts it to a NumPy array.

Q-Learning and Meta Q-Learning Setup: Initializes Q-tables and sets hyperparameters (alpha, meta_alpha, gamma, epsilon), defines actions for Pac-Man's movements.

Game Logic: Main game loop handles the game state, rendering, and updating Q-values. Ghost movements are dynamically adjusted to stay within maze boundaries. Pac-Man's movements are guided by Q-Learning, with Meta Q-Learning for continuous improvement.

Rewards and Penalties: Defines rewards for collecting items and reaching the end. Implements penalties for colliding with ghosts and revisiting previous states.

GIF Recording: Captures each frame of the game and saves the fastest episodes as GIFs, allowing for visual analysis of Pac-Man's pathfinding efficiency.

Strategic Recommendations
Dynamic Maze Adjustments: Implement varying maze configurations to further test and improve the model's adaptability.
Enhanced Ghost AI: Develop more sophisticated ghost movement patterns to increase game difficulty and challenge the model's learning capabilities.
Player Feedback Integration: Collect player feedback to refine game mechanics and improve overall user experience.
Continuous Model Training: Regularly update the model with new gameplay data to maintain high performance and adaptability.
Economic and Environmental Impact
Increased Engagement: A more challenging and dynamic game is likely to attract and retain more players, potentially increasing revenue from ads or in-game purchases.
Cost Savings: Efficient coding practices and optimization reduce computational resource usage, leading to cost savings in development and deployment.
Educational Value: Promotes understanding and interest in AI and machine learning among players and developers, contributing to educational advancement in these fields.
Conclusion
By leveraging Meta Q-Learning, this project creates a dynamic and challenging Pac-Man game that continuously improves with each playthrough. The approach not only enhances gameplay but also serves as a practical demonstration of advanced machine learning techniques. Implementing these recommendations will lead to a more engaging and educational gaming experience.
